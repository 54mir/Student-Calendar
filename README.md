## Inspiration
During Covid, the youngest elementary school students have had the hardest time adapting to virtual learning.
Young kids don’t always know what they’re supposed to be doing at any given point in the day. Usually, teachers let them know and can inform them if there is a change to the routine. Now parents have to keep track, but they may not always be available to manage.
 
## What it does
A simple app with user-friendly UI that connects to a teacher managed google calendar. Shows the current event. Teacher can add links and directions to a calendar event and all that information shows prominently on the user side - so students/parents know exactly what the student should be doing at that particular moment in time. 

## How we built it
We used react, javascript, ical files, and google calendar api to parse teacher's class calendars and display it to students in an approachable way.

## What's next for NowThis
We'll extend this to mobile!
